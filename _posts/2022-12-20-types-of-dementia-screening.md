## Introduction

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (7) is the most widely applied test for dementia screening. Since the intellec- tual property rights of the MMSE were transferred to Psychological Assessment Resources in 2001, it has become less accessible and useful (7,8).

## Discussion

The Mini-Cog test is relatively simple and short compared with the MMSE.
