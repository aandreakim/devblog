## Introduction

The notion of reserve appears to play a pivotal part in preventing and developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, I will explore in this blog cognitive reserve and its role in AD.

## What is reserve?

The concept of reserve is that it acts as a moderator between brain change and clinical outcome. In other words, reserve plays a role in triggering the actual clinical outcome due to changes in the brain, both physically and functionally.  

## What is cognitive reserve?

The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) states that the brain actively tries to cope with brain damage by using pre-existing cognitive approaches or by creating entirely new compensatory mechanisms. This means an individual with higher CR would be better able to cope with brain damage than one with lower CR.

## What is brain reserve?

The initial concept of brain reserve states that reserve is quantitative. This means an individual with a larger brain, or more neurons, is less likely to get dementia than another with a smaller brain. However, recent studies have found that, reserve can further be improved through activities or environments that give rise to the growth of new neurons (via neurogenesis) and/or upregulate BDNF, which fosters neural plasticity. 

## What role do they play on Alzheimer's Disease?

Those with higher brain reserve and/or CR have a lower risk of developing dementia, by 38% and 46% respectively. Nonetheless, once AD emerges in patients, those with higher reserve show faster decline.
