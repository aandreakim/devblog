## Overview

Alike to many other social media platforms, Instagram has multiple features from posting to messaging to shopping. In this short blog, we will break down the mobile application into its smaller elements.

## 1. Logging in

The first step to using almost any mobile app is logging in - and Instagram is no exception! To access the contents of Instagram, you must have an active account and log into that account. This can be done by either creating a new account or logging into an already-existing one!

## 2. Home page

Instagram's home page consists of numerous different features that can make it difficult to navigate. The first feature users will encounter is their feed, which displays the posts and stories uploaded by other users they follow. Then, by swiping leftward, users can open the Direct Messages feature, where they can create conversations with other Instagram users. At the bottom of the page are four other features: the explore page, reels page, shopping page, and profile page.

## 3. The explore page

As the name suggests, the explore page is where users are able to explore Instagram and its contents beyond the realm of other users they follow. Users can either use the search feature to search for specific content or scroll through the explore feed which is a compilation of posts and videos from other random users.

## 4. The reels page

This page is a continuous scroll of videos made by other users of Instagram. Users can like, comment, share, and/or save Instagram reels. Many users have stated that Instagram reels are very similar to Youtube shorts or Tiktoks, both from other online social media platforms.

## 5. The shopping page

This page consists of many shopping items, suggested by Instagram based on its user-tracking algorithm. Users can either add these items to their "Wishlist" or click on the item's name tag, which redirects the user to the shop's external website.

## 6. The profile page

This page contains all the information about the user's profile. The user can view their own current and previous posts and stories.
