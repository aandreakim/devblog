## What is ACE?

Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) and its subsequent modified versions are psychological tests used to identify cognitive impairment. The ACE was initially developed as an extension of the [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/mini-mental-state-examination-mmse) but over time has been further refined into ACE-R and ACE-III.

## What is ACE-R?

ACE-R, short for Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised, is the first modified version of the ACE. It is used mainly to differentiate subtypes of dementia like Alzheimer's disease, supranuclear palsy, and other diseases invovlved in parkinsonism.

## What does ACE-R assess?

**[ACE-R](https://advancemed.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ace-r_aus_versiona1.pdf) evaluates 6 cognitive areas:**

**1. Orientation:** Ability to describe the weather and their current location
**2. Attention:** Ability to spell basic words and carry out simple mathematical subtraction exercises

**3. Memory:** Ability to remember words and information

## How is the test scored?

ACE-R is scored out of 100 total points, with a higher mark indicating better cognitive function. Geneally, a score below 82 indicates likely dementia. As compared to other common dementia screening tests which are marked out of around 30 total marks, ACE-R's 100-point scale demonstrates that it is a much more comprehensive examination.
