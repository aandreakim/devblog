## Introduction

치매체크 (translation: Dementia Check) is a dementia diagnosis app produced by the South Korean government. The government maintained that 'Dementia Check' was designed to be "convenient for anyone with a smartphone". However, many users have reported a variety of issues and inconveniences regarding this app. Thus, I have began creating an Information Architecture (IA) flowchart that breaks down the functions of the app to its very basic steps. This blog will explore two problems, which the online user reviews mention most frequently.

## Problem 1: Lengthy log-in process 

The first step to using almost any mobile app is logging in. Because this is usually to swiftly set up an account and allow you to safely proceed to actually using the app, logging in should frankly be the simplest of the steps. But in Dementia Check, logging in may be one of the most complicated steps to receiving your unconfirmed diagnosis! THe diagram below illustrates the IA breakdown of the log-in phase:

When initially creating their accounts, the app requires users to state whether they are adults or minors, which does not appear to be a necessary step unless it affects the user's diagnosis (which it does not). Further, Dementia Check requires users to verify their identities using an external app. Then, it asks the user to set up their account by creating a username and password and entering personal information - seems pretty normal? Wrong. The app then requires the user to re-enter their username and password to finally proceed the dementia diagnosis. Keeping in mind that most of these users will be elderlies or their mid-50s' daughters and sons who suspect dementia, Dementia Check's log-in process appears excessively lengthy and redundant. 

To overcome this issue, the government could replace this current log-in system with a simple one-click log-in process that is linked to a widely used app such as Kakao Talk or Naver. This would reduce the current steps to merely 3 steps.

## Problem 2: 

The next problem is the app's User Experience (UX) design - specifically pertaining to the colour combinations used. The app's primary colour is a bright orange, on which any coloured text can be quite difficult to read. The app's main choice of text colour is white. The colour contrast makes the text rather challenging to read, which is exacerbated by the elderly population's tendency to have weak vision.

This could definitely be overcome by changing the colour combination of Dementia Check to ones that have been empirically proven to delivery smooth UX and makes text easier to read. Great examples are (black and white) and (grey-blue and white).

## What's next?

To improve upon these issues and a plethora of other issues with Dementia Check, the next most-urgent step is to create a dementia diagnosis app which is more concise and easier to use, especially catered for those who are older and less familiar with modern technology.
