## Introduction

In the previous blog, we identified the two main UX problems in Dementia Check, the government-produced dementia diagnosis mobile app. One of these problems was the app's colour combination and I suggested a change in this. Thus, this blog will explore the potential colour combinations for an improved diagnosis app.

## Primary colour

The primary colour of an app or website is the colour that is used or seen most frequently. It is usually the colour we associate with an app. For example, yellow for Snapchat and red for Youtube. In the new dementia diagnosis, I thought a cream-beige colour would be suitable as it is known to be a calming neutral colour that well-complements the Seafoam colour, which I will introduce next. It is important to implement calming colours as the users may be nervous about their results, and calmness further ensures an accurate assessment of the users' cognition.

## Secondary colour

The secondary colour of an app or website is the colour that is displayed second most frequently. For the dementia diagnosis app, I chose Seafoam as the secondary colour as it is a more neutral shade of green that fosters calmness and is widely used to soothe stress. For instance, performers often wait in a room with Seafoam-coloured wallpapers to help calm their nerves. Applying this same idea to users who may fear that they have dementia, Seafoam can help keep users calm.

This could definitely be overcome by changing the colour combination of Dementia Check to ones that have been empirically proven to delivery smooth UX and makes text easier to read. Great examples are (black and white) and (grey-blue and white).

## Semantic colours

The semantic colours of an app or website are the colours used to indicate a specific outcome. For example, in a game, most people associate red with failure as it would be accompanied by a text such as "GAME OVER". So the semantic colour for failure would be red. In this way, red was used for error messages, orange for warning messages, green for success, and blue for any kind of information. Sticking to the general theme of toned-down pastel colours, I chose relativley dull semantic colours as such:
