## Where can I find the Mini-Cog App?

The Mini-Cog App is available for downloading on the Google Playstore.

## Why is the app only available on Google Playstore?

Though we plan to expand accessibility to the Apple App Store too in the future, the Mini-Cog App's initial launch was made available only for android devices because 95% of all elderly mobile phone users in South Korea are android users. Since the app's target users were elderlies in South Korea, we found the Google Playstore to be most suitable market.
